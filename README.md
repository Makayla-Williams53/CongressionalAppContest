## App for the 2022 Congressional App Contest

This was a project that was created alongside my classmates Maddison Chau(Maddison C) and Alexa Torres(Alexa G Torres) for the 
2022 Congressional App Contest. We submitted this project to Riverside house Representative Ken Calvert.
We chose to make an app that provided various information about the disesases that affect the Inland Empire.
There was the use of bar graphs in order to show the rates of infection in various areas.
